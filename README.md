# Problems

The major problems in Agriculture in Nigeria are:

1: High Ignorance<br>
In this present generation, an average Nigerian youth have little or no interest in Agriculture.
They have no idea how profitable and interesting commercial Agriculture is.
Most of the people in the country today have the mentality that farmers are poor and do not pull enough respect in the society,
but then they never knew that without them there will be no provision of food or natural herbs.

2: Illiteracy<br>
Most farmers in Nigeria are usually Illiterate.
Illiteracy is also among the major problems of Agricultural development in Nigeria.
Many farmers who are truly dedicated to the profession do not know how to read and write.
Apart from that, they lack the knowledge of modern practices and innovation in farming.
All these can hinder a proper and optimal practice of Agriculture.

3: Disorganization and unaccountability<br>
Apart from illiteracy, most farmers do not know how to keep farm records.
This makes then to lose track of their activities on the farm, and they cannot give proper account of their finances too.
This nonchalant attitude towards organisation is another major problems of Agricultural Development in Nigeria.

5: Poor Agricultural policies<br>
Once there are poor Government policies targeted towards agriculture, this will definitely yield a poor result.

# Proposed Solution

We made this web application basically not finished, but in progress; for farmers to begin engagement with technologies and easier ways of farming.<br>
This consist of a weather report section that will use a twilio _SMS Api_ for sending of current weather report and climate chages to all farmers signed up based on their location; and also tell them a little advice about the grow of a specific crop.<br>
Also have a section that will store the farm records for later use of the farmer or user.<br>
<br>
Basically made for farmers, farm dealers and farm tools sellers for buying and selling of crops and also renting of farm tools

# Proposed Stack

## Technologies:

NodeJS, Express js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Html, Css
