# Problems
The major problems in Agriculture in Nigeria are:

1: No finding or capitalization(Poverty)
    Poverty is one of the major problems facing Agricultural development in Nigeria. 
    Insufficient funds or capital can limit farmers from acquiring large hectares of land in order to practice mechanised farming. 
    This can lead to reduction in the production of foods.

2: High Ignorance
    In this present generation, an average Nigerian youth have little or no interest in Agriculture. 
    They have no idea how profitable and interesting commercial Agriculture is. 
    Most of the people in the country today have the mentality that farmers are poor and do not pull enough respect in the society,
    but then they never knew that without the there will b no propvision of food and natural herbs.

3: Illiteracy
    Most farmers in Nigeria are usually Illiterate.
    Illiteracy is also among the major problems of Agricultural development in Nigeria. 
    Many farmers who are truly dedicated to the profession do not know how to read and write. 
    Apart from that, they lack the knowledge of modern practices and innovation in farming. 
    All these can hinder a proper and optimal practice of Agriculture.

4: Bad road
    Bad road network affects the transportation of agricultural produce. 
    This hinders the transportation of agricultural produce from the farms to the various areas where they are needed.

5: Poor power supply
    The epileptic power supply experienced in Nigeria is nothing to write home about. 
    It have a negative effect on agriculture too. 
    This is because perishable foods such as tomato, fish and the likes,
    cannot be stored properly because there is little or no electricity to power the cooling equipment such as refrigerators, cold rooms etc
    that way 20 - 35% of the farm produce will end up perishing. 

6: Disorganization and unaccountability
    Apart from illiteracy, most farmers do not know how to keep farm records. 
    This makes then to lose track of their activities on the farm, and they cannot give proper account of their finances too. 
    This nonchalant attitude towards organisation is another major problems of Agricultural Development in Nigeria.

7: Poor Agricultural policies
    Once there are poor Government policies targeted towards agriculture, this will definitely yield a poor result

8: Global wariming
    The global warming and changes in climatic conditions does have a negative effect on crop yields. 
    Droughts, Erosion and so on, are major problems of Agricultural Development in Nigeria.
